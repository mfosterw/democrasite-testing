# Democrasite alpha
This is a WIP for a website that allows users to submit pull requests to the site's source code and then vote on those pull requests.

It is accessible at [democrasite.herokuapp.com](https://democrasite.herokuapp.com/) or, as a shortcut, [democrasite.tech](http://democrasite.tech).

This version is officially deprecated (and will no longer be deployed). Check out the newer version [here](https://github.com/mfosterw/cookiestocracy).
